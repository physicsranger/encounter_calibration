# encounter_calibration
 A code package to (roughly) simulate d&d encounters in an an attempt to produce quantitative measures for the encounter difficulty categories.
 
 This repository is brand new, nothing much to see yet.  More details will be added to the readme as development progresses.  This idea sprang out of a brainstorming session where I was trying to come up with a personal data science project to showcase skills and trying to think of things I'm interested in.  I then realized there may not be a data set (at least not one I can access) to do what I wanted, so I would have to make one.
 
 A barebones representation of the idea behind the project is to simulate encounters by considering "average" values of hit points, attack bonuses, damage, etc., for both the player characters and enemies.  The potential intricacies involved are many, and this project would never even get started if I tried to incorporate everything (bonus actions, saving throws, etc.).  Additionally, the great thing about any table top rpg are the crazy, creative moves players come up with.  When those succeed, they can throw any traditional estimates/calculations out the window; however, if we look at the behavior on average, then we can simply imagine those acts to be in the tails of the estimated behavior.
 
 To begin, the code will assume 1$^{st}$ level characters only.  If the crazy idea in my head turns out to be doable and the results seem reasonable, then I might explore adding more complication.
