    "### Running Many Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've generated out configuation files, we can run many simulations, for battles of each difficulty rating, in parallel and save the output in CSV files (one per difficulty rating).  This is done via the ```generate_encounter_results``` function in the _run\\_encounters_ script.  This function uses custom classes from the _encounter_ and _battle\\_group_ scripts along with the _pandas_ and _multiprocessing_ modules and a supplied YAML configuration file to take care of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important question is \"how many simulations\"?  Let's first put the goal in context and then answer that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about table top roleplaying games is the player creativity in overcoming encounters, be they combat or social.  Trying to capture this creativity would require a far more sophisticated simulation.  However, some creative ideas succeed and some fail, so these outcomes will be 'in the tails.'  Therefore, we use a simple simulation to assess outcomes on average for each difficulty rating, with lofty ideas for future enhancements, and use our own, and crowd sourced, experience to evaluate how the assumptions and simplifications hold up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to assess the difficulty ratings via descriptive statistics and plots, such as \"How many party resources is such an encounter expected to require?\"  A given difficulty rating encompasses a range of scenarios, so these questions will result in a range of values.  We will want enough simulations to have a good feeling for the core of that range of values, but also to explore what the tails look like, even though we expect that these simple simulations will not accurately capture all of the crazy possibilities real game play can sometimes result in.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these considerations in mind, and some experience generating simulations for more controlled situations, we will opt for 10,000 simulations to start with.  Once we start digging into the simulated data, we can evaluate if this (somewhat arbitrary) choice needs to be revisited."

    "For an 'easy' encounter, we would generally expect that the party would almost always win.  That seems to be the case, with only 78 encounters out of 10,000 where the party failed.  Interestingly, the number of PCs unconscious at the end of the encounter (denoted by the 'num\\_party\\_down' column) is always 1, and the challenge rating is always 1.  This seems to indicate that PCs were knocked down, brought back up, maybe knocked down again, and then the final blow managed to put the total hit points of the party below zero.  This could be viewed as imitating a series of unlucky rolls for the PCs, lucky rolls for the enemies, and one final area of effect attack wiping out the party.\n",

    "Area of effect attacks are not explicitly put into the simulation, so this may be a bit of a stretch.  While we have dug into the code to explore why this is happening, we will carefully examine the results, including for other difficulty ratings, in a different notebook to assure ourselves it isn't a bug in the code."
